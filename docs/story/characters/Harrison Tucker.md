# Family and background

Harrison had an uneventful childhood. He's always had a couple friends, but never a best friend. His friendlist was fluctuating constantly, whoever he thought was the coolest at any given moment.

In high-school, he became obsessed with computer science and hacking. He became very introverted and started spending most of his time online, playing games and trying to hack computers for fun.

His parents started to annoy him about sitting at the computer all day, so he moved out into his own flat near an industrial area.

He's helping out friends at a club from time to time to pay for bills and food. His lifestyle is very rudimentary.

He's been in a long-distance relationship with Alice Monroe for the past two years. They've never met eachother in real life yet.

# Introduction to the game

He's very active on the HackerHub IRC. He's the first person to interact with the player and invite him/her to the hub.

# Hacking experience

Harrison will guide the player into the basics. He's been involved in a couple operations of the past and seems to prepare something big for the near future.
