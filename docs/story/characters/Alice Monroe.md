# Family and background

Alice thinks of herself as a dark lady. She dresses mostly black, likes piercings and got a tattoo of the devil on her left wrist.

She's cut her arms before, but not to the extent of life-threatening bleeding. She's stopped cutting for as long as she's been together with Bob, her current boyfriend.

She's been through depression over her dad being an asshole and leaving Alice and her mother alone, not paying financial support either. Her tattoo is a tribute to her dad, who would hit her hands, when she was still a child before he left the family.

Alice was not a wanted child, and only came to be as an accident. Her father forced her mom into carrying out birth, as he is strictly against abortions due to his religious views.

She stopped seeing her best friend Stella, as she also got a boyfriend, who doesn't like Stella to see or talk to other people.

# Introduction to the game

Bob invited her into the IRC, as he wanted to show off to others, that he really had a girlfriend. They've been on the IRC for 2 years now, chatting away.

# Hacking experience

Alice has not been involved into actual hacking operations, but has witnessed Bob and his friends inside chats. Having seen these operations take place she has a good sense of what's possible in todays age of technology though.

If she really wanted, it would probably take little practice for her to do her own operations.
